# AdventOfCode2021

Learning to code from scratch through Advent of Code! 
I tried to solve them in Python 3

Many thanks to Eric for the amazing puzzles, with the exception of occasional evilness. 

intriugingly, I feel like the quality of code went on a bell curve. Where it improved a lot as I initially progressed and learnt more. But when the challenges got much harder I ended up focusing on finding ways to solve the problems, and fell back into using global variables and lots of loops.
